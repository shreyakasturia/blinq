        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>The project began with thorough research into various freelance job websites to understand user needs and
            industry standards. Wireframing and prototyping were utilized to explore different design concepts and user
            flows.</p>
        <p>A mood board was created to capture the desired aesthetic and tone for the platform. Visual design elements
            were carefully chosen to enhance user engagement and brand identity.</p>
        <p>Iterative design processes were employed to refine the initial designs based on user feedback and usability
            testing. The final design aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for both freelancers and
            clients.</p>
